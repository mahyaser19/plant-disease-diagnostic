        'symptoms': ['symptom1', 'symptom2', ...],
        'description': 'Detailed description',
        'treatment': 'Treatment instructions',
        'product_recommendations': [
            {
                'name': 'Product name',
                'type': 'Product type',
                'description': 'Product description'
            }
        ]
    }
}
